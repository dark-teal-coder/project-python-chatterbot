## Repository Description 

...

### Steps to Run the Code

#### 1. Git-clone the repository 
Use the git-clone command `git clone https://github.com/dark-teal-coder/project-python-chatterbot.git` to clone the repository to a directory/folder in which you want to work.

#### 2. Install Python 3.7.9 on your computer

You need to use a Python version below 3.8 to successfully work with the recommended version of ChatterBot. Python 3.7.9 is recommended. To check all the Python versions installed on your system, type `py -0` in PowerShell. If you do not have the recommended Pyhon version, download and install it. To download Python 3.7.9, go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/).

#### 3. Create a virtual environment with Python 3.7

Use the command `py -3.7 -m venv <venv-name>`, where `<venv-name>` is the name of your virtual environment, to create a virtual environment with Python 3.7 in your project folder. If you do not specify the Python version, it will use the default Python version on your system.

#### 4. Activate the virtual environment

After creating the virtual environment, you will see a new folder created under the name you gave to your virtual environment. To activate the virtual environment, type `.\<venv-name>\Scripts\activate`, where `<venv-name>` is the name of your virtual environment.

#### 5. Check Python version in the virtual environment

Use the command `python --version` to check the Python version in the virtual environment. If you have not activated the virtual environment, it will display the default Python version on your system.

#### 6. Install libraries

Use the command `python -m pip install chatterbot==1.0.4 pytz` to install `chatterbot` and `pytz` in your virtual environment. 

Alternatively, you can also use the `requirements.txt` to install the dependencies needed for this project. Type `pip install -r requirements.txt` into a CLI.

#### 7. Run chatbot 

Use the command `python <chatbot-name>.py`, where `<chatbot-name>` is the name of your chatbot Python file, to run the code and start chatting with the chatbot.
