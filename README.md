# project-python-chatterbot

## Steps to Run the Code

### 1. Install Python 3.7.9 on your computer

You need to use a Python version below 3.8 to successfully work with the recommended version of ChatterBot. Python 3.7.9 is recommended. To check all the Python versions installed on your system, type `py -0` in PowerShell. If you do not have the recommended Pyhon version, download and install it. To download Python 3.7.9, go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/).

### 2. Create a virtual environment with Python 3.7

Use the command `py -3.7 -m venv <venv-name>`, where `<venv-name>` is the name of your virtual environment, to create a virtual environment with Python 3.7 in the project folder. If you do not specify the Python version, it will use the default Python version on your system.

### 3. Activate the virtual environment

After creating the virtual environment, you will see a new folder created under the name you gave to your virtual environment. To activate the virtual environment, type `.\<venv-name>\Scripts\activate`, where `<venv-name>` is the name of your virtual environment.

### 4. Check Python version in the virtual environment

Use the command `python --version` to check the Python version in the virtual environment. If you have not activated the virtual environment, it will display the default Python version on your system.
